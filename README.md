## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v19.7.0)
  - Might work with earlier versions, but this is the one I used, so I can't guarantee it will work with earlier versions.
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)
- A Chrome executable that supports the [new headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/headless-chrome/) (e.g. Chrome v59+ on macOS, Chrome v60+ on Windows)
  - You can check your Chrome version by going to `chrome://version` in your browser.
  - You might be able to use other browsers, but I haven't tested it.

## Setup

Your environment needs two environment variables:

- `CHROME_PATH` - the path to your Chrome executable
- `OPENAI_API_TOKEN` - your OpenAI API key

> HINT: If you set these in the `.env` file in the project's root directory, the CLI will automatically load them for you! (see the `.env.example` file for an example)
